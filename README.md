# Used Car Price Analysis Project

## 🚗 Project Overview

This project focuses on collecting and analyzing data from [Cars24.com](https://www.cars24.com), a popular platform for buying and selling used cars. The main goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on used car listings to understand market trends, price patterns, and key factors affecting car prices.

## 📊 Project Phases

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Web scraping is performed using Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Data is extracted from Cars24’s website, including important attributes such as:
  - Car model
  - Price
  - Mileage
  - Year of manufacture
  - Location
- The raw data is saved in a structured format (CSV or Excel) for further analysis.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The dataset is imported using `pandas`.
- Data cleaning is done to handle missing values and correct inconsistent data types.
- Visualizations are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to:
  - Understand data distributions
  - Detect outliers
  - Explore relationships between variables (e.g., Price vs Year, Price vs Mileage)
- Insights help to understand factors impacting used car prices.
